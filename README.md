## Kubernetes Deployment using Tekton Pipelines

Tekton is an open source project to configure and run CI/CD pipelines within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Introduction

In this tutorial you'll learn
* what are the basic concepts used by Tekton pipelines
* how to create a pipeline to build and deploy a container
* how to run the pipeline, check its status and troubleshoot problems

## Prerequisites

Before you start the tutorial you must set up a Kubernetes environment with Tekton installed.

* [Install the CLIs to manage a cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_install_steps)

* [Create a standard Kubernetes cluster in IBM Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#clusters_ui_standard)

    **Note**:
    * Tekton Pipelines v0.11 or higher requires Kubernetes version 1.15 or higher.
    * The tutorial uses a standard cluster because it supports dynamic provisioning of storage volumes.

* Connect to your Kubernetes cluster,

    ```bash
    export CLUSTER_ID=<cluster id>
    ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster $CLUSTER_ID
    kubectl config current-context
    ```

* Create a new namespace,

    ```bash
    export NS=tekton101
    kubectl create namespace $NS
    ```

* A container registry, e.g. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com), [Quay.io](https://quay.io) or [IBM Container Registry (ICR)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-registry), see [Create a private container registry in IBM Container Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-registry_setup_cli_namespace#registry_setup_cli_namespace)

* Install Tekton in your cluster.  This tutorial was written using Tekton version 0.27.3. If you use a later version you may encounter some functional differences.

    Versions at the time of writing this tutorial:

  * Pipelines: v0.27.3
  * Triggers: v0.16.0
  * CLI: v0.20.0

    Install Tekton,

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.27.3/release.yaml
    ```

    Monitor the installation using the following command until all components show a Running status:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines --watch

    NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    tekton-pipelines-controller-f79ff758b-scprc   1/1     Running   0          20s
    tekton-pipelines-webhook-85569ddf68-dqtdc     1/1     Running   0          18s
    ```

* [Install the Tekton Pipelines CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli#installing-tkn)

    The IBM Cloud Shell already has the Tekton CLI installed,

    ```bash
    $ tkn version
    
    Client version: 0.12.0
    Pipeline version: v0.27.3
    Triggers version: unknown
    ```

## Steps

### 1. Tekton pipeline concepts

Tekton provides a set of extensions to Kubernetes, in the form of [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/), for defining pipelines.
The following diagram shows the resources used in this tutorial.  The arrows depict references from one resource to another resource.

![crd](doc/source/images/crd.png)

The resources are used as follows.

* A **PipelineRun** defines an execution of a pipeline.  It references the **Pipeline** to run.
* A **Pipeline** defines the set of **Tasks** that compose a pipeline.
* A **Task** defines a set of build steps such as compiling code, running tests, and building and deploying images.

We will go into more detail about each resource during the walkthrough of the example.

Let's create a simple pipeline that

* builds a Docker image from source files and pushes it to your private container registry
* deploys the image to your Kubernetes cluster

### 2. Clone the repository

You should clone this project to your workstation since you will need to edit some of the yaml files before applying them to your cluster.
Check out the `beta-update` branch after cloning.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/tekton-tutorial
cd tekton-tutorial
git checkout beta-update
```

We will work from the bottom-up, i.e. first we will define the Task resources needed to build and deploy the image,
then we'll define the Pipeline resource that references the tasks,
and finally we'll create the PipelineRun resource needed to run the pipeline.

### 3. Create a task to clone the Git repository

The first thing that the pipeline needs is a task to clone the Git repository that the pipeline is building.
This is such a common function that you don't need to write this task yourself.
Tekton provides a library of reusable tasks called the [Tekton catalog](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog).
It provides a `git-clone` task which is described [here](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/v1beta1/git#git-clone).

The task is reproduced below so that we can talk about it.

```bash
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: git-clone
spec:
  workspaces:
  - name: output
    description: The git repo will be cloned onto the volume backing this workspace
  params:
  - name: url
    description: git url to clone
    type: string
  - name: revision
    description: git revision to checkout (branch, tag, sha, refï¿½)
    type: string
    default: master
  - name: submodules
    description: defines if the resource should initialize and fetch the submodules
    type: string
    default: "true"
  - name: depth
    description: performs a shallow clone where only the most recent commit(s) will be fetched
    type: string
    default: "1"
  - name: sslVerify
    description: defines if http.sslVerify should be set to true or false in the global git config
    type: string
    default: "true"
  - name: subdirectory
    description: subdirectory inside the "output" workspace to clone the git repo into
    type: string
    default: "src"
  - name: deleteExisting
    description: clean out the contents of the repo's destination directory (if it already exists) before trying to clone the repo there
    type: string
    default: "false"
  results:
  - name: commit
    description: The precise commit SHA that was fetched by this Task
  steps:
  - name: clone
    image: gcr.io/tekton-releases/github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/cmd/git-init:latest
    script: |
      CHECKOUT_DIR="$(workspaces.output.path)/$(params.subdirectory)"

      cleandir() {
        # Delete any existing contents of the repo directory if it exists.
        #
        # We don't just "rm -rf $CHECKOUT_DIR" because $CHECKOUT_DIR might be "/"
        # or the root of a mounted volume.
        if [[ -d "$CHECKOUT_DIR" ]] ; then
          # Delete non-hidden files and directories
          rm -rf "$CHECKOUT_DIR"/*
          # Delete files and directories starting with . but excluding ..
          rm -rf "$CHECKOUT_DIR"/.[!.]*
          # Delete files and directories starting with .. plus any other character
          rm -rf "$CHECKOUT_DIR"/..?*
        fi
      }

      if [[ "$(params.deleteExisting)" == "true" ]] ; then
        cleandir
      fi

      /ko-app/git-init \
        -url "$(params.url)" \
        -revision "$(params.revision)" \
        -path "$CHECKOUT_DIR" \
        -sslVerify="$(params.sslVerify)" \
        -submodules="$(params.submodules)" \
        -depth="$(params.depth)"
      cd "$CHECKOUT_DIR"
      RESULT_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD | tr -d '\n')"
      EXIT_CODE="$?"
      if [ "$EXIT_CODE" != 0 ]
      then
        exit $EXIT_CODE
      fi
      # Make sure we don't add a trailing newline to the result!
      echo -n "$RESULT_SHA" > $(results.commit.path)
```

A task can have one or more steps.  Each step defines an image to run to perform the function of the step.
This task has one step that uses a Tekton-provided container to clone a Git repo.

A task can have parameters.  Parameters help to make a task reusable.
This task accepts many parameters such as:

* the URL of the Git repository to clone,
* the revision to check out.

Parameters can have default values provided by the task or the values can be provided by the `Pipeline` and `PipelineRun` resources that we'll see later.
Steps can reference parameter values by using the syntax `$(params.name)` where `name` is the name of the parameter.
For example the step uses `$(params.url)` to reference the `url` parameter value.

The task requires a workspace where the clone is stored.
From the point of view of the task, a workspace provides a file system path where it can read or write data.
Steps can reference the path using the syntax `$(workspaces.name.path)` where `name` is the name of the workspace.
We'll see later how the workspace becomes associated with a storage volume.

Apply the file to your cluster to create the task.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/v1beta1/git/git-clone.yaml -n $NS
```

### 4. Create a task to build an image and push it to a container registry

The next function that the pipeline needs is a task that builds a docker image and pushes it to a container registry.
The catalog provides a `kaniko` task which does this using Google's `kaniko` tool.
The task is described [here](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/v1beta1/kaniko).

The task is reproduced below.

```bash
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: kaniko
spec:
  params:
  - name: IMAGE
    description: Name (reference) of the image to build.
  - name: DOCKERFILE
    description: Path to the Dockerfile to build.
    default: ./Dockerfile
  - name: CONTEXT
    description: The build context used by Kaniko.
    default: ./
  - name: EXTRA_ARGS
    default: ""
  - name: BUILDER_IMAGE
    description: The image on which builds will run
    default: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest
  workspaces:
  - name: source
  results:
  - name: IMAGE-DIGEST
    description: Digest of the image just built.

  steps:
  - name: build-and-push
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
    image: $(params.BUILDER_IMAGE)
    # specifying DOCKER_CONFIG is required to allow kaniko to detect docker credential
    # https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/706
    env:
    - name: DOCKER_CONFIG
      value: /tekton/home/.docker
    command:
    - /kaniko/executor
    - $(params.EXTRA_ARGS)
    - --dockerfile=$(params.DOCKERFILE)
    - --context=$(workspaces.source.path)/$(params.CONTEXT)  # The user does not need to care the workspace and the source.
    - --destination=$(params.IMAGE)
    - --oci-layout-path=$(workspaces.source.path)/image-digest
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 0
  - name: write-digest
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
    image: gcr.io/tekton-releases/github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/cmd/imagedigestexporter:v0.11.1
    # output of imagedigestexport [{"key":"digest","value":"sha256:eed29..660","resourceRef":{"name":"myrepo/myimage"}}]
    command: ["/ko-app/imagedigestexporter"]
    args:
    - -images=[{"name":"$(params.IMAGE)","type":"image","url":"$(params.IMAGE)","digest":"","OutputImageDir":"$(workspaces.source.path)/image-digest"}]
    - -terminationMessagePath=image-digested
  - name: digest-to-results
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
    image: stedolan/jq
    script: |
      cat image-digested | jq -j '.[0].value' | tee /tekton/results/IMAGE-DIGEST
```

You can see that this task needs a workspace as well.
This workspace has the source to build.
The pipeline will provide the same workspace that it used for the `git-clone` task.

The `kaniko` task also uses a feature called results.
A result is a value produced by a task which can then be used as a parameter value to other tasks.
This task declares a result named `IMAGE-DIGEST` which it sets to the digest of the built image.
A task sets a result by writing it to a file named `/tekton/results/name` where `name` is the name of the result, in this case `IMAGE-DIGEST`.
We will see later how the pipeline uses this result.

You may be wondering about how the task authenticates to the image repository for permission to push the image.
This will be covered later on in the tutorial.

Apply the file to your cluster to create the task.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/v1beta1/kaniko/kaniko.yaml -n $NS
```

### 5. Create a task to deploy an image to a Kubernetes cluster

The final function that the pipeline needs is a task that deploys a docker image to a Kubernetes cluster. At the time of writing this tutorial, the Tekton catalog did not have a `kubectl-run` task yet, so we are using a custom task called `deploy-using-kubectl`.

You can find the yaml file for `deploy-using-kubectl` at [tekton/tasks/deploy-using-kubectl.yaml](tekton/tasks/deploy-using-kubectl.yaml).

```bash
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: deploy-using-kubectl
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: git-source
      description: The git repo
  params:
    - name: pathToYamlFile
      description: The path to the yaml file to deploy within the git source
    - name: imageUrl
      description: Image name including repository
    - name: imageTag
      description: Image tag
      default: "latest"
    - name: imageDigest
      description: Digest of the image to be used.
  steps:
    - name: update-yaml
      image: alpine
      command: ["sed"]
      args:
        - "-i"
        - "-e"
        - "s;__IMAGE__;$(params.imageUrl):$(params.imageTag);g"
        - "-e"
        - "s;__DIGEST__;$(params.imageDigest);g"
        - "$(workspaces.git-source.path)/$(params.pathToYamlFile)"
    - name: run-kubectl
      image: lachlanevenson/k8s-kubectl
      command: ["kubectl"]
      args:
        - "apply"
        - "-f"
        - "$(workspaces.git-source.path)/$(params.pathToYamlFile)"
```

```bash
cat tekton/tasks/deploy-using-kubectl.yaml
```

This task has two steps.

1. The first step runs `sed` in an Alpine Linux container to update the yaml file used for deployment with the image that was built by the `kaniko` task.
The step requires the yaml file to have two character strings, `__IMAGE__` and `__DIGEST__`, which are substituted with parameter values.

2. The second step runs `kubectl` using Lachlan Evenson's popular `k8s-kubectl` container image to apply the yaml file to the same cluster where the pipeline is running.

As was the case in the git-clone and kaniko tasks, this task makes use of parameters in order to make the task as reusable as possible.
It also needs the workspace to get the deployment yaml file.

You may be wondering about how the task authenticates to the cluster for permission to apply the resource(s) in the yaml file.
This will be covered later on in the tutorial.

Apply the file to your cluster to create the task.

```bash
kubectl apply -f tekton/tasks/deploy-using-kubectl.yaml -n $NS
```

### 6. Create a pipeline

Below is a Tekton pipeline that runs the tasks we defined above.

You can find this yaml file at [tekton/pipeline/build-and-deploy-pipeline.yaml](tekton/pipeline/build-and-deploy-pipeline.yaml).

```bash
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: build-and-deploy-pipeline
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: git-source
      description: The git repo
  params:
    - name: gitUrl
      description: Git repository url
    - name: pathToContext
      description: The path to the build context, used by Kaniko - within the workspace
      default: src
    - name: pathToYamlFile
      description: The path to the yaml file to deploy within the git source
    - name: imageUrl
      description: Image name including repository
    - name: imageTag
      description: Image tag
      default: "latest"
  tasks:
    - name: clone-repo
      taskRef:
        name: git-clone
      workspaces:
        - name: output
          workspace: git-source
      params:
        - name: url
          value: "$(params.gitUrl)"
        - name: subdirectory
          value: "."
        - name: deleteExisting
          value: "true"
    - name: source-to-image
      taskRef:
        name: kaniko
      runAfter:
        - clone-repo
      workspaces:
        - name: source
          workspace: git-source
      params:
        - name: CONTEXT
          value: $(params.pathToContext)
        - name: IMAGE
          value: $(params.imageUrl):$(params.imageTag)
    - name: deploy-to-cluster
      taskRef:
        name: deploy-using-kubectl
      workspaces:
        - name: git-source
          workspace: git-source
      params:
        - name: pathToYamlFile
          value: $(params.pathToYamlFile)
        - name: imageUrl
          value: $(params.imageUrl)
        - name: imageTag
          value: $(params.imageTag)
        - name: imageDigest
          value: $(tasks.source-to-image.results.IMAGE-DIGEST)
```

A Pipeline resource contains a list of tasks to run.
Each pipeline task is assigned a `name` within the pipeline;  here they are `clone-repo`, `source-to-image`, and `deploy-using-kubectl`.

The pipeline configures each task via the task's parameters.
You can choose whether to expose a task parameter as a pipeline parameter, set the value directly, or let the value
default inside the task (if it's an optional parameter).  For example this pipeline exposes the `CONTEXT` parameter from the
kaniko task (under a different name, `pathToContext`) but does not expose the `DOCKERFILE` parameter and allows it to default inside the task.

This pipeline also shows how to take the result of one task and pass it to another task.
We saw earlier that the `kaniko` task produces a result named `IMAGE-DIGEST` that holds the digest of the built image.
The pipeline passes that value to the `deploy-using-kubectl` task by using the syntax `$(tasks.source-to-image.results.IMAGE-DIGEST)`
where `source-to-image` is the name used in the pipeline to run the `kaniko` task.

By default Tekton assumes that pipeline tasks can be executed concurrently.
In this pipeline each pipeline task depends on the previous one so they must be executed sequentially.
One way that dependencies between pipeline tasks can be expressed is by using the `runAfter` key.
It specifies that the task must run after the given list of tasks has completed.
In this example, the pipeline specifies that the `source-to-image` pipeline task must run after the `clone-repo` pipeline task.

The `deploy-using-kubectl` pipeline task must run after the `source-to-image` pipeline task but it doesn't need to specify the `runAfter` key.
This is because it references a task result from the `source-to-image` pipeline task
and Tekton is smart enough to figure out that this means it must run after that task. 

Apply the file to your cluster to create the pipeline.

```bash
kubectl apply -f tekton/pipeline/build-and-deploy-pipeline.yaml -n $NS
```

### 7. Define a Service Account

Before running the pipeline, we need to set up a service account so that it can access protected resources. The credentials to authenticate the service account to a private container registry are stored in a secret. The service account binds a secret containing credentials for authentication to RBAC-related resources for permission to access a container registry or to create and modify Kubernetes resources.

#### Container Registry

If you use Docker Hub or Quay as your private container registry, you can use your username and password credentials to authenticate.

#### IBM Container Registry

If you use the IBM Container Registry, you first need create an IBM Cloud API key. The process for creating an API key is described [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-registry_access#registry_access).

If you do not have an IBM Cloud API Key yet, create one as follows,

```bash
$ export SERVICE_ID_NAME=<user1-tekton101-serviceid>
$ export SERVICE_ID_APIKEY_NAME=<user1-apikey>

$ ibmcloud iam service-id-create $SERVICE_ID_NAME

Creating service ID user1-tekton101-serviceid bound to current account as user1@email.com...
OK
Service ID user1-tekton101-serviceid is created successfully
                 
ID            ServiceId-a123b4cd-56ef-7g89-hij0-k123lkm45n67   
Name          user1-tekton101-serviceid   
Description      
CRN           crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::a/abc123def456::serviceid:ServiceId-a123b4cd-56ef-7g89-hij0-k123lkm45n67    
Version       1-11c9ab5605ade2507e73c2b143747988   
Locked        false

$ ibmcloud iam service-api-key-create $SERVICE_ID_APIKEY_NAME $SERVICE_ID_NAME

Creating API key user1-apikey of service ID user1-tekton101-serviceid under account abc123def456 as user1@email.com...
OK
Service ID API key user1-apikey is created

Please preserve the API key! It cannot be retrieved after it's created.
                 
ID            ApiKey-a1234b5c-6789-01d2-3e4f-gh5d2930711a   
Name          user1-apikey   
Description      
Created At    2021-10-22T23:30+0000   
API Key       a1234b5c-6789-01d2-3e4f-gh5d2930711a    
Locked        false   
```

#### Create Authentication Secret

After you have the container registry credentials or API key, you can create the following secret.

```bash
export REGISTRY=https://index.docker.io/v1/
export $REGISTRY_USERNAME=<docker username or `apikey`>
export $REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<docker password or IBM Cloud APIKEY>

kubectl create secret generic ibm-registry-secret --type="kubernetes.io/basic-auth" --from-literal=username=$REGISTRY_USERNAME --from-literal=password=$REGISTRY_PASSWORD -n $NS
kubectl annotate secret ibm-registry-secret tekton.dev/docker-0=$REGISTRY -n $NS
```

where

* `<REGISTRY_USERNAME>` is the username to authenticate to your container registry, or if you use an API key to authenticate the literal `apikey`.
* `<REGISTRY_PASSWORD>` is the password to authenticate to your container registry, or if you use an API key to authenticate the API key that you created.
* `<REGISTRY>` is the domain of your container registry, such as `https://index.docker.io/v1/` or `us.icr.io` (you can find out the domain name of your IBM Cloud Registry in your targeted region using the command `ibmcloud cr region`).

This secret will be used to both push and pull images from your registry.

#### Create Service Account

Now you can create the service account using the following yaml.
You can find this yaml file at [tekton/pipeline-account.yaml](tekton/pipeline-account.yaml).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: pipeline-account
secrets:
- name: ibm-registry-secret

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: kube-api-secret
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: pipeline-account
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token

---

kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: pipeline-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["services"]
  verbs: ["get", "create", "update", "patch"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "create", "update", "patch"]

---

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pipeline-role-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: pipeline-role
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: pipeline-account
```

This yaml creates the following Kubernetes resources:

* A ServiceAccount named `pipeline-account`.
The service account references the `ibm-registry-secret` secret so that the pipeline can authenticate to your private container registry
when it pushes and pulls a container image.

* A Secret named `kube-api-secret` which contains an API credential (generated by Kubernetes) for accessing the Kubernetes API.
This allows the pipeline to use `kubectl` to talk to your cluster.

* A Role named `pipeline-role` and a RoleBinding named `pipeline-role-binding` which provide the resource-based access control permissions
needed for this pipeline to create and modify Kubernetes resources.

Apply the file to your cluster to create the service account and related resources.

```bash
kubectl apply -f tekton/pipeline-account.yaml -n $NS
```

### 8. Create a PersistentVolumeClaim

The workspace used by the pipeline to clone the Git repository is mapped to a PersistentVolumeClaim which is a request for StorageVolume. Before you run the pipeline for the first time, you must create the PersistentVolumeClaim for the workspace.

```bash
kubectl create -f tekton/picalc-pipeline-pvc.yaml -n $NS
```

The PersistentVolumeClaim requests Kubernetes to obtain a storage volume. Since each PipelineRun references the same claim and thus the same volume, this means the PipelineRun can only be run serially to avoid conflicting use of the volume. There is [funtionality coming in Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/2326) to allow each PipelineRun to create its own PersistentVolumeClaim and thus use its own volume.

```bash
$ kubectl get pvc picalc-source-pvc -n $NS
NAME                STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS     AGE
picalc-source-pvc   Pending                                      ibmc-file-gold   11s
```

Check that the PersistentVolumeClaim is bound before continuing. Creating the storage, the PersistentVolume, and the PersistentVolumeClaim could take up to 2 or 3 minutes.

```bash
$ kubectl get pvc picalc-source-pvc -n $NS
NAME                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS       AGE
picalc-source-pvc   Bound    pvc-662946bc-57f2-4ba5-982c-b0fa9db1d065   20Gi       RWO            ibmc-file-bronze   2m
```

### 9. Create a PipelineRun

We've defined reusable Pipeline and Task resources for building and deploying an image.
It is now time to look at how one runs the pipeline.

Below is a Tekton PipelineRun resource that runs the pipeline we defined above.
You can find this yaml file at [tekton/run/picalc-pipeline-run.yaml](tekton/run/picalc-pipeline-run.yaml).

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: picalc-pr-
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-and-deploy-pipeline
  params:
    - name: gitUrl
      value: https://github.com/IBM/tekton-tutorial
    - name: pathToYamlFile
      value: kubernetes/picalc.yaml
    - name: imageUrl
      value: <REGISTRY>/<NAMESPACE>/picalc
    - name: imageTag
      value: "1.0"
  serviceAccountName: pipeline-account
  workspaces:
    - name: git-source
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: picalc-source-pvc
```

Although this file is small there is a lot going on here.  Let's break it down from top to bottom:

* The PipelineRun does not have a fixed name.  It uses `generateName` to generate a name each time it is created. This is because a particular PipelineRun resource executes the pipeline only once.  If you want to run the pipeline again, you cannot modify an existing PipelineRun resource to request it to re-run -- you must create a new PipelineRun resource While you could use `name` to assign a unique name to your PipelineRun each time you create one, it is much easier to use `generateName`.

* The Pipeline resource is identified under the `pipelineRef` key.

* Parameters exposed by the pipeline are set to specific values such as the Git repository to clone, the image to build, and the yaml file to deploy. This example builds a [go program that calculates an approximation of pi](src/picalc.go). The source includes a [Dockerfile](src/Dockerfile) which runs tests, compiles the code, and builds an image for execution.

* You must edit the `picalc-pipeline-run.yaml` file to substitute the values of `<REGISTRY>` and `<NAMESPACE>` with the information for your private container registry.

    ```bash
    vi tekton/run/picalc-pipeline-run.yaml
    ```

  * To find the value for `<REGISTRY>` for IBM Cloud Registry, enter the command `ibmcloud cr region`. For 
  * To find the value for `<NAMESPACE>` for IBM Cloud Registry, enter the command `ibmcloud cr namespace-list`.

* The service account named `pipeline-account` which we created earlier is specified to provide the credentials needed for the pipeline to run successfully.

### 10. Run the pipeline

All the pieces are in place to run the pipeline.

```bash
$ kubectl create -f tekton/run/picalc-pipeline-run.yaml -n $NS

pipelinerun.tekton.dev/picalc-pr-c7hsb created
```

Note that we're using `kubectl create` here instead of `kubectl apply`.
As mentioned previously a given PipelineRun resource can run a pipeline only once so you need to create a new one each time you want to run the pipeline. `kubectl` will respond with the generated name of the PipelineRun resource.

Let's use the `tkn` CLI to check the status of the PipelineRun.
While you can check the status of the pipeline using the `kubectl describe` command, the `tkn` cli provides much nicer output.

```bash
$ tkn pipelinerun describe -n $NS picalc-pr-c7hsb

Name:              picalc-pr-c7hsb
Namespace:         tekton101
Pipeline Ref:      build-and-deploy-pipeline
Service Account:   pipeline-account

 picalc-pr-c7hsb-clone-repo-pvbsk        clone-repo        2 minutes ago    1 minute   Succeeded
```

This tells us that the pipeline is running. The `clone-repo` pipeline task has completely successfully and the `source-to-image` pipeline task is currently running.

Continue to rerun the command to check the status.  If the pipeline runs successfully, the description eventually should look like this:

```bash
$ tkn pipelinerun describe -n $NS picalc-pr-c7hsb
Name:              picalc-pr-c7hsb

 picalc-pr-c7hsb-clone-repo-pvbsk          clone-repo          12 minutes ago   1 minute     Succeeded
```

Check the status of the Kubernetes deployment.  It should be ready.

```bash
$ kubectl get deploy picalc
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
picalc   1/1     1            1           9m
```

You can curl the application using its NodePort service.
First display the nodes and choose one of the node's external IP addresses.
Then display the service to get its NodePort.

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

#### Debugging a failed PipelineRun

Let's take a look at what a PipelineRun failure would look like.
Edit the PipelineRun yaml and change the gitUrl parameter to a non-existent Git repository to force a failure.
Then create a new PipelineRun and describe it after letting it run for a minute or two.

```bash
$ kubectl create -f tekton/picalc-pipeline-run.yaml

pipelinerun.tekton.dev/picalc-pr-sk7md created

$ tkn pipelinerun describe picalc-pr-sk7md
Name:              picalc-pr-sk7md
Namespace:         tekton101
Pipeline Ref:      build-and-deploy-pipeline
Service Account:   pipeline-account

Status

STARTED         DURATION     STATUS

```

The output tells us that the `clone-repo` pipeline task failed.  The `Message` also tells us how to get the logs from the pod which was used to run the task:

```bash
for logs run: kubectl -n tekton101 logs picalc-pr-sk7md-clone-repo-8gs25-pod-v7fg8 -c step-clone
```

If you run that `kubectl logs` command you will see that there is a failure trying to fetch the non-existing Git repository.

An even easier way to get the logs from a PipelineRun is to use the `tkn` CLI.

```bash
tkn pipelinerun logs picalc-pr-sk7md-clone-repo-8gs25-pod-v7fg8 -t clone-repo
```

If you omit the `-t` flag then the command will get the logs for all pipeline tasks that executed.

You can also get the logs for the last PipelineRun for a particular Pipeline using this command:

```bash
tkn pipeline logs build-and-deploy-pipeline -L
```

You should delete a PipelineRun when you no longer have a need to reference its logs.  Deleting the PipelineRun deletes the pods that were used
to run the pipeline tasks.

## Summary

Tekton provides simple, easy-to-learn features for constructing CI/CD pipelines that run on Kubernetes.
This tutorial covered the basics to get you started building your own pipelines.
There are more features available and many more planned for upcoming releases.
